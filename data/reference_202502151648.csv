The contact resistance of T2 copper blocks with different roughnesses is predicted by deep learning at room temperature and cyclic loading. The contact resistance problem can be regarded as a regression problem of mapping the high-dimensional array space of multiple variables to the contact resistance. This paper measures the contact resistance of copper blocks with different surface roughnesses under loading and unloading states and obtains the original dataset required by the algorithm. The data characteristics include three surface topography parameters, number of cyclic loads, loading and unloading conditions, and load magnitude, with the data labeled contact resistance. This paper compares the results of the NN model and Holm model results to verify the NN modelu2019s effectiveness. The comparison results show that the prediction results of the NN are consistent with the predictions of the Holm model. After training and debugging, the root mean square error of the multiple hidden layers neural network test set is 6.81%, showing a good prediction effect. In conclusion, the deep learning algorithm provides a new way for fast and accurate prediction of the relationship between T2 copper blocks and contact resistance under cyclic loading times and unloading states.</jats:p>"",""DOI"":""10.1063/5.0095871"",""type"":""journal-article"",""created"":{""date-parts"":[[2022,7,5]],""date-time"":""2022-07-05T11:49:59Z"",""timestamp"":1657021799000},""update-policy"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/aip-crossmark-policy-page"",""source"":""Crossref"",""is-referenced-by-count"":2,""title"":[""Prediction of contact resistance between copper blocks under cyclic load based on deep learning algorithm""],""prefix"":""10.1063"",""volume"":""12"",""author"":[{""given"":""Zeyang"",""family"":""Feng"",""sequence"":""first"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Department of Mechanics and Engineering Science, College of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, Lanzhou University 1 , Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, Peopleu2019s Republic of China""},{""name"":""Key Laboratory of Mechanics on Environment and Disaster in Western China, The Ministry of Education of China, Lanzhou University 2 , Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, Peopleu2019s Republic of China""}]},{""given"":""Jiangtao"",""family"":""Yan"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Department of Mechanics and Engineering Science, College of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, Lanzhou University 1 , Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, Peopleu2019s Republic of China""},{""name"":""Key Laboratory of Mechanics on Environment and Disaster in Western China, The Ministry of Education of China, Lanzhou University 2 , Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, Peopleu2019s Republic of China""}]},{""ORCID"":""http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9536-0070"",""authenticated-orcid"":false,""given"":""Yuanwen"",""family"":""Gao"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Department of Mechanics and Engineering Science, College of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, Lanzhou University 1 , Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, Peopleu2019s Republic of China""},{""name"":""Key Laboratory of Mechanics on Environment and Disaster in Western China, The Ministry of Education of China, Lanzhou University 2 , Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, Peopleu2019s Republic of China""}]}],""member"":""317"",""published-online"":{""date-parts"":[[2022,7,5]]},""reference"":[{""key"":""2023080903225024200_c1"",""doi-asserted-by"":""publisher"",""first-page"":""195101"",""DOI"":""10.1063/1.4921110"",""volume"":""117"",""year"":""2015"",""journal-title"":""J.

   the thermal contact resistance depends not only on the thermal conductivity

The technique is based on heating one solid surface by a modulated laser beam and monitoring the corresponding temperature modulation of the other solid surface across the interface using the reflectance of a probe laser beam. The phase lag between the two laser signals is independent of the optical properties of the samples as well as the laser intensities, and can be related to the thermal contact conductance. A detailed theoretical analysis is presented to estimate the thermal contact conductance as well as the thermophysical properties of the solids from the phase lag measured as a function of the modulation frequency. Closed-form solutions in the high-frequency limit are derived in order to provide a simple estimation procedure. The effect of misalignment of the two lasers is studied and the conditions for robust measurements are suggested. As a benchmark for this technique, the thermal conductivity of a single crystal silicon sample was measured to within two percent of reported values. The thermal contact conductance was measured for Al-Si samples, each about 0.22 mm thick, in the pressure range of 0.8u201310 MPa. In contrast to traditional contact conductance measurement techniques that require steady-state operation and insertion of thermocouples in thick solid samples, the noncontact dynamic optical technique requires much less time and is particularly well suited for electronic packaging materials that are typically in the thickness range of 0.1u20135 mm. In addition, localized conductance measurements are now possible with a spatial resolution of about four times the thickness of the solid and can be used to detect interfacial voids and defects.</jats:p>"",""DOI"":""10.1115/1.2826086"",""type"":""journal-article"",""created"":{""date-parts"":[[2008,2,25]],""date-time"":""2008-02-25T23:46:03Z"",""timestamp"":1203983163000},""page"":""954-963"",""update-policy"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/crossmarkpolicy-asme"",""source"":""Crossref"",""is-referenced-by-count"":46,""title"":[""Optical Measurement of Thermal Contact Conductance Between Wafer-Like Thin Solid Samples""],""prefix"":""10.1115"",""volume"":""121"",""author"":[{""given"":""Y."",""family"":""Ohsone"",""sequence"":""first"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720""}]},{""given"":""G."",""family"":""Wu"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720""}]},{""given"":""J."",""family"":""Dryden"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada""}]},{""given"":""F."",""family"":""Zok"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Materials Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106""}]},{""given"":""A."",""family"":""Majumdar"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720""}]}],""member"":""33"",""published-online"":{""date-parts"":[[1999,11,1]]},""reference"":[{""key"":""2019100508485886500_r1"",""unstructured"":""Boyer H.

Thermal contact resistance between heat resistant steel 2Cr12NiMoWV/aluminum alloy BH137 interfaces and 2Cr12NiMoWV/titanium alloy ?-TiAl interfaces were experimentally investigated in the present paper. The effects of contact pressure and interface tem-perature were detailed. The temperature of contacting surfaces was from 80- 250?, and the contact pressure ranged from 2-17 MPa. All experiments were conducted in ambient atmosphere. Results showed that thermal contact resistance decreases with an increment of interface temperature or contact pressure. Under the same conditions of contact pressure and interface temperature, thermal contact resistance between 2Cr12NiMoWV and BH137 interfaces is lower than that between 2Cr12NiMoWV and ?-TiAl interfaces. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity and mechanical properties was analyzed to explain the results. Furthermore, with the piston and piston pin as the research object, steady state temperature fields were simulated in cases of considering thermal contact resistance and without considering thermal contact resistance, respectively. The results showed that the maximum temperature of the piston pin will be lower when thermal contact resistance is considered.</jats:p>"",""DOI"":""10.2298/tsci191018470l"",""type"":""journal-article"",""created"":{""date-parts"":[[2019,12,31]],""date-time"":""2019-12-31T11:57:37Z"",""timestamp"":1577793457000},""page"":""313-324"",""source"":""Crossref"",""is-referenced-by-count"":4,""title"":[""Effects of contact pressure and interface temperature on thermal contact resistance between 2Cr12NiMoWV/BH137 and u03b3-TiAl/2Cr12NiMoWV interfaces""],""prefix"":""10.2298"",""volume"":""24"",""author"":[{""given"":""Yuwei"",""family"":""Liu"",""sequence"":""first"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""School of Mechanical Electronic and Information Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China""}]},{""given"":""Yameng"",""family"":""Ji"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China""}]},{""given"":""Fuhao"",""family"":""Ye"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd., Beijing, China""}]},{""given"":""Weizheng"",""family"":""Zhang"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China""}]},{""given"":""Shujun"",""family"":""Zhou"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""School of Mechanical Electronic and Information Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China""}]}],""member"":""1078"",""container-title"":[""Thermal Science""],""original-title"":[],""language"":""en"",""deposited"":{""date-parts"":[[2023,5,29]],""date-time"":""2023-05-29T10:47:55Z"",""timestamp"":1685357275000},""score"":1,""resource"":{""primary"":{""URL"":""https://doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?ID=0354-98361900470L""}},""subtitle"":[],""short-title"":[],""issued"":{""date-parts"":[[2020]]},""references-count"":0,""journal-issue"":{""issue"":""1 Part A"",""published-print"":{""date-parts"":[[2020]]}},""URL"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/tsci191018470l"",""relation"":{},""ISSN"":[""0354-9836"",""2334-7163""],""issn-type"":[{""value"":""0354-9836"",""type"":""print""},{""value"":""2334-7163"",""type"":""electronic""}],""subject"":[],""published"":{""date-parts"":[[2020]]}}}",""

   resistance, we have proposed a new experimental approach for measurement of
   the thermal contact resistance. Taking the thermal contact resistance between
   phenolic resin and carbon-carbon composites, cuprum, and aluminum as the
   examples, the influence of the thermal contact resistance between specimens
   under pressure is tested by experiment. Two groups of experiments are
   performed and then an analysis on influencing factors of the thermal contact
   resistance is presented in this paper. The experimental results reveal that
   the thermal contact resistance depends not only on the thermal conductivity
   coefficient of materials, but on the interfacial temperature and pressure.
   Furthermore, the thermal contact resistance between cuprum and aluminum is
   more sensitive to pressure and temperature than that between phenolic resin
   and carbon-carbon composites.</jats:p>"",""DOI"":""10.2298/tsci1504369z"",""type"":""journal-article"",""created"":{""date-parts"":[[2015,11,5]],""date-time"":""2015-11-05T09:36:15Z"",""timestamp"":1446716175000},""page"":""1369-1372"",""source"":""Crossref"",""is-referenced-by-count"":4,""title"":[""Effects of pressure and temperature on thermal contact resistance between different materials""],""prefix"":""10.2298"",""volume"":""19"",""author"":[{""given"":""Zhe"",""family"":""Zhao"",""sequence"":""first"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Beijing Jiaotong University, Institute of Engineering Mechanics, Beijing, China""}]},{""given"":""Hai-Ming"",""family"":""Huang"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Beijing Jiaotong University, Institute of Engineering Mechanics, Beijing, China""}]},{""given"":""Qing"",""family"":""Wang"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Durham University, School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Durham, United Kingdom""}]},{""given"":""Song"",""family"":""Ji"",""sequence"":""additional"",""affiliation"":[{""name"":""Beijing Jiaotong University, Institute of Engineering Mechanics, Beijing, China""}]}],""member"":""1078"",""container-title"":[""Thermal Science""],""original-title"":[],""language"":""en"",""deposited"":{""date-parts"":[[2023,5,29]],""date-time"":""2023-05-29T11:15:13Z"",""timestamp"":1685358913000},""score"":1,""resource"":{""primary"":{""URL"":""https://doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?ID=0354-98361504369Z""}},""subtitle"":[],""short-title"":[],""issued"":{""date-parts"":[[2015]]},""references-count"":0,""journal-issue"":{""issue"":""4"",""published-print"":{""date-parts"":[[2015]]}},""URL"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/tsci1504369z"",""relation"":{},""ISSN"":[""0354-9836"",""2334-7163""],""issn-type"":[{""value"":""0354-9836"",""type"":""print""},{""value"":""2334-7163"",""type"":""electronic""}],""subject"":[],""published"":{""date-parts"":[[2015]]}}}",""

It is demonstrated that, for many surfaces commonly encountered in engineering practice, the macroscopic constriction has a commanding influence. Extensive results are given for brass, magnesium, stainless steel, and aluminum surfaces which show the effects of material properties and the degree of conformity of mating surfaces under load. Limited results are presented to show the influence of surface films, surface roughness, creep, additional interstitial material, mean interface temperature, etc. Good agreement between the measured and predicted values of the thermal contact resistance was found over wide ranges of the applied load and other system variables.</jats:p>"",""DOI"":""10.1115/1.3689082"",""type"":""journal-article"",""created"":{""date-parts"":[[2012,2,28]],""date-time"":""2012-02-28T08:21:08Z"",""timestamp"":1330417268000},""page"":""243-250"",""update-policy"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/crossmarkpolicy-asme"",""source"":""Crossref"",""is-referenced-by-count"":112,""title"":[""Thermal Contact Resistance in a Vacuum Environment""],""prefix"":""10.1115"",""volume"":""87"",""author"":[{""given"":""A.
